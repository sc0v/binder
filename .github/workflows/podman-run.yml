        # First we stop and remove the binder container and image, then pull the new package.
        # Simply getting the master tagged package seems to always pick an older version,
        # So query the github api for all versions and find the SHA-256 of the second 
        # most recent (GitHub seems to make multiple packages with each docker-publish run,
        # and this seems to be the correct one to take)
