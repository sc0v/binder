<h2><%= Time.now.year %> SPRING CARNIVAL MIDWAY RELEASE OF LIABILITY</h2>

<p>
I, <strong><%= @user.name %></strong>, want to participate in Carnegie Mellon University (“CMU”) <%= Time.now.year %> Spring Carnival Midway construction
activities and/or be present on the Midway construction site (collectively, the “Activities.”) I understand
that the Activities may involve climbing, crawling, physical exertion, the use of and/or proximity to hand
and power tools and construction materials and equipment.
</p>

<p>
I understand that there are risks (including, but not limited to, the risk of injury, disability and death)
associated with my participation in the Activities. I voluntarily assume all the risks. In consideration of
the benefits of participation in the Activities, I hereby, on behalf of myself and those acting on my
behalf, irrevocably and unconditionally release, waive and promise not to sue CMU from/for any and all
liabilities, losses, injuries, damages, claims, demands, actions and/or causes of action related to my
participation in the Activities, including the securing of, or failure to secure, medical treatment for me.
</p>

<p>
The laws of Pennsylvania shall apply to this Release. If any of its provisions are declared illegal,
unenforceable or ineffective, they shall be deemed severable and all other provisions shall remain valid and binding.
